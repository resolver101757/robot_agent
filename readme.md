# Robot Agent Setup and Usage

## Description
This notebook, `robot_agent.ipynb`, guides users through the process of setting up a openAI robot agent, presumably for tasks in a manufacturing or automation context. It includes steps for importing necessary libraries, setting up tooling, creating the robot agent, and performing actions with the robot.

## Installation
To use this notebook, ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Additionally, specific libraries required for the robot agent setup will be listed in the notebook. Install these libraries using pip or conda as per your environment setup.

## Usage
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook:
1. Import libraries and set up the environment.
2. Set up tooling for the robot agent.
3. Create a robot agent (possibly an OpenAI assistant).
4. Initialize the thread for the robot agent.
5. Extract and use the tool from the robot agent to perform actions.
6. Instructions for removing the agent (assistant) when necessary.
